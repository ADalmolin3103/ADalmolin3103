## About me:

My name is, and i am a student of Computer Science at FURB, located at Blumenal (SC), in Brazil. Perfectionist when it comes to give effot and time onto a project. A lyrics enjoyer and music addict 🎵 

🔭 I’m currently working on a website to share my knowledge and make friends, inviting people to do the same, its name is <a href="https://lucaswl.tk" target=" _blank"> Harmony's Archives </a>. Come give it a try! Still in *work in progress though!*

I'm also developing a calculator for Computer Architecture class (Just for the challenge, no grades and class involved, just sheer will of me wanting to improove). Will share more as i develop it.

## Intelectual domains:

So now its time to take my knowledge and divide into 2 categories, plus one: languages im learning, have somewhat of understanding, and will learn in the future:
